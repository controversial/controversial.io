        Image2ASCII is a Python library I wrote which is capable of approximating images with text,
        creating ASCII art from any source. To make the tool more accessible, I also wrapped the
        library in a simple app using <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a>.

        Image2ASCII generates artwork by looking at the source image and matching brightness levels
        in different parts of the image with characters that have an approximately appropriate
        "visual weight" on the page. Characters that fill more of their area with black, like <code>W</code>
        or <code>$</code> are considered to have a high visual weight, while characters like <code>.</code>
        and <code>'</code>, which leave most of the space they occupy blank, are considered to have
        low visual weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to apply this principle, the first step that the program takes is to generate a map
        between characters and their visual weights. The program renders each ASCII glyph onto a
        canvas the size of one character, and computes the average brightness of the resulting
        image. Lower brightnesses indicate characters with more visual weight, because more of the
        image is black.

        After building the map between each character and its visual weight, image2ASCII assigns
        characters to different portions of the image. The image is converted to black and white,
        its contrast increased to improve clarity of the ASCII art, and then the image is downscaled
        to a size where each pixel could be reasonably represented by a single character. Then,
        pixel-by-pixel the character with the visual weight most similar to the brightness of the
        pixel in question is selected and added to the output string. The result is the entire
        artwork represented as text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Image2ASCII provides functions for rendering artwork onto an image for display, but the
        example to the left uses the raw text output and dynamically renders it onto a canvas.
