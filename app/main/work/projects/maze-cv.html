        <code>maze-cv</code> is a proof-of-concept tool that runs on iOS devices capable of solving
        mazes plotted on special graph paper, with minimal user input. The tool is built on the
        fantastic <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a> platform for Python
        development on iOS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built <code>maze-cv</code> to learn about basic image manipulation and computer vision
        algorithms, so I implemented all of the logic involved myself, without borrowing from
        high-level libraries like <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV</a>, but instead by reading
        image values pixel-by-pixel using the <a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python Imaging Library</a>.

        Since <code>maze-cv</code> was designed more as a proof-of-concept than a practical tool, it
        does impose several restrictions on the user. Mazes must be plotted on a 16x16 graph paper
        grid between four clearly marked red squares. This makes the task of interpreting the maze
        much easier for the program, because the location of the maze is easily identifiable and the
        size of the grid is known.

        The first step that <code>maze-cv</code> takes is to identify the corners of the maze by
        finding the red markers. Each pixel in the image is searched and its hue and saturation are
        inspected in order to determine which pixels are "red." Then, a breadth-first-search
        algorithm is used to connect adjacent red pixels. The image to the left shows a test in
        which the center of each identified red object in an image is marked with a small black
        square.

        The next step that <code>maze-cv</code> goes through is to transform the maze to get a
        straight-on view of it, to eliminate the variable of perspective. This allows the program to
        view the 16x16 grid as a grid and to easily segment each piece of the maze later.

        <code>maze-cv</code> uses. Hover the animation to highlight the box being transformed.

        The third step that <code>maze-cv</code> performs on the image is to threshold the image.
        Using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.420.7883&rep=rep1&type=pdf">adaptive thresholding</a>
        to avoid errors caused by shadows on the page, each pixel in the transformed image is
        determined to be either light or dark, resulting in an image like the one to the left.
      </p>
      <p>
        This image can now be easily segmented to determine the value of each square in the 16x16
        grid.

    </div>

      <p>
        After being transformed and thresholded, the image is segmented. The grid of pixels is split
        into 256 chunks of equal size, one for each square on the 16x16 grid. Within each segment,
        the value of each thresholded pixel (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) is averaged. A
        weighted average is used such that pixels near the center of the segment are counted more
        than those near the edges; this helps correct for cases in which the grid isn't quite lined
        up after transformation. A weighted average of less than <code>0.5</code> (more dark than
        light pixels) is considered to be a wall (black square), while a weighted average greater
        than <code>0.5</code> is considered to be traversible path (a white square). By repeating
        this calculation with each square, a pixel map like the one to the right is generated.

      <p>
        The final step, after the image is segmented, is to solve the maze. A graph is constructed,
        in which all white squares are nodes. Using breadth-first-search on the data from the
        previous step, adjacent white squares are connected by edges of equal weight in the graph.
        Then, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to solve (the A* algorithm doesn't bring sufficient
        performance improvements to mazes of this size to justify its increased complexity of
        implementation).
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the user has to manually mark the starting and ending points on
        the maze, but this could change in a future version.
