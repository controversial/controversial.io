        I designed and developed arkis.io as a landing page for the recently-founded software
        development group Arkis, which consists of myself and several of the other students with whom I
        took AP Computer Science in the 2016-2017 school year.

        The site’s development required mastery of both front-end and back-end development. The back-end
        is written in Node, and serves both to power the site’s contact form and to serve the twitter
        profile images of each member of the group. The front-end combines advanced CSS3 and JavaScript
        to create sophisticated animations.

        The first thing users see when entering the website is a CSS-powered "intro animation." This
        consists of several CSS keyframe animations playing in series in order to provide a
        compelling introduction to the site. The animation ensures that users are engaged and pulled
        into the site from the beginning.

        The site also includes more sophisticated JS-powered animations. At the bottom of the page,
        immediately after the intro animation plays, is a "mist" animation. This creates a sense of
        atmosphere and also provides a smooth boundary between the first and second major sections
        of content on the page while scrolling. The effect is achieved via a basic particle
        simulation, where each of the particles is rendered as a small "cloud" texture. When the
        particles move and rotate past each other, a convincing effect of dynamic fog is achieved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hover over the animation to reveal markers indicating the position and rotation of each
        moving particle.

        Apart from the complex front-end elements, arkis.io is supported by a full back-end hosted
        on <a target="_blank" href="https://zeit.co/now">Now</a>. The back-end caches and serves
        twitter profile images for each of the members listed on the site, and powers the contact
        form, which allows visitors to submit messages which land as emails in my personal inbox.
        The animation to the right is shown as an intermediate state before the back-end has
        confirmed successfully sending a user's message.
