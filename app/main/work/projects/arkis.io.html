        I designed and developed arkis.io as a landing page for the recently-founded software
        development group Arkis, which consists of myself and several of the other students with whom I
        took AP Computer Science in the 2016-2017 school year.

        The site’s development required mastery of both front-end and back-end development. The back-end
        is written in Node, and serves both to power the site’s contact form and to serve the twitter
        profile images of each member of the group. The front-end combines advanced CSS3 and JavaScript
        to create sophisticated animations.
