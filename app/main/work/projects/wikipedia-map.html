        Wikipedia map is a web app for visualizing the connections between Wikipedia articles. The
        project scrapes Wikipedia and uses the links between pages that are present in each article
        as an indicator of articles about topics that might be connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project originally featured a Python/Flask back-end, but for increased maintainability
        I've since migrated the backend to a Node.js/Express app hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://zeit.co/now">Now</a>.
        The back-end is responsible for all of the logic of fetching, parsing, and processing each
        page's HTML in order to extract the links.

      <p>
        Only the links from the first paragraph of each Wikipedia article are included, because the
        first paragraph links tend to be the links to topics most revlevant to the article. For
        example, the image to the right highlights the links that Wikipedia map selects from the
        first paragraph of the "Cat" article.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also has the benefit of preventing long articles from expanding with a ridiculous and
        confusing amount of information.
