        Wikipedia map is a web app for visualizing the connections between Wikipedia articles. The
        project scrapes Wikipedia and uses the links between pages that are present in each article
        as an indicator of topics that might be connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        After simply entering any topic for which a Wikipedia article exists, users can begin to
        explore connected topics via an interactive navigable graph (rendered on a <code>canvas</code>
        using <a href="https://github.com/almende/vis">vis.js</a>) which displays all of the
        articles which the user has "discovered." After a while exploring the map, a large graph of
        hundreds of connected topics is formed.

        The main interface to Wikipedia Map is its graph. The graph presents each article as a
        round blue bubble, a "node," and each node can be clicked to expand into multiple new
        "connected" nodes for related articles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each node expansion requires a request to the Wikipedia Map back-end. The project originally
        featured a Python/Flask back-end, but for increased maintainability I've since migrated the
        backend to a Node.js/Express app hosted on <a target="_blank" href="https://zeit.co/now">Now</a>.
        The back-end is responsible for all of the logic of fetching, parsing, and processing each
        Wikipedia article's HTML in order to extract the links.

        Only the links from the first paragraph of each Wikipedia article are included, because the
        first paragraph links tend to be the links to topics most revlevant to the article. For
        example, the image to the right highlights the links that Wikipedia map selects from the
        first paragraph of the "Cat" article.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also has the benefit of preventing long articles from expanding with a ridiculous and
        confusing amount of information.

        Wikipedia Map's main goal is to present relationships between topics in a digestible format.
        Several subtle aspects of the web app help to achieve this goal. First, nodes are lighter in
        color when they are farther away from the central node.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if the user started with "Penguin" and it took 5 expansions to reach "Ancient
        Greek", "Ancient Greek" would be a lighter color than a node like "Birding," which only took
        2 steps to reach. This indicates that "Birding" is a topic more closely connected with
        "Penguin" than "Ancient Greek."

        Second, when the user hovers over any node in the graph, the path that the user took to
        reach that article is highlighted. This helps users visualize exactly how, step by step, two
        topics on the graph are connected, which is useful for breaking down the connections between
        distantly-related articles.
