        <code>ui2</code> is a Python module for the iOS app Pythonista <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a>
        which builds on top of Pythonista's <code>ui</code> module to add functionality and
        convenience. <code>ui2</code> empowers script authors to take advantage of a much wider
        range of components, allowing them to create more complex, beautiful, and effective
        interfaces. The project was commissioned by another community member, who thought that I
        had the necessary skill to carry out the project and paid me to complete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>ui2</code> lets users access UI components like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/mkmapview"><code>MKMapView</code></a>
        that are not available through the original <code>ui</code> module, and also provides
        pure-python abstractions of <code>ui</code> features to add flexibility and convenience,
        such as allowing the chaining of multiple animations.

        One of the most significant improvements that <code>ui2</code> makes over <code>ui</code> is
        the abundance of new Python classes wrapping <code>UIKit</code> views that were previously
        inaccessible from Pythonista. These include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>BlurView</code>, which wraps <code>UIVisualEffectView</code> to create the
            "frosted glass" effect common since iOS 7
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>CameraView</code>, which wraps <code>AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer</code> to display
            a live camera feed, useful for building camera-based UIs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>MapView</code>, which wraps <code>MKMapView</code> to display a mutable Apple Maps
            view. The coordinates and scale of the map can be read and controlled programmatically,
            so with a little effort interactive graphics can be precisely placed on top of
            geographical features.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>ProgressPathView</code>, which wraps <code>CAShapeLayer</code> and <code>CGPath</code>
            to allow using a <code>Path</code> of any shape to form a progress bar.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>and many more.</p>

        Beyond <code>UIView</code> classes, <code>ui2</code> provides an extensive set of tools for
        fully creating complex and polished user interfaces including interactivity, animations, and
        transitions. <code>ui2</code> builds upon some Pythonista interfaces to add new features,
        but also implements its own new pure-Python interfaces and wraps some new Objective-C APIs.
        Some of the new non-<code>UIView</code> features included in <code>ui2</code>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            New <code>Transition</code> and <code>ChainedTransition</code> classes that
            interface with the Objective-C <code>[UIView transitionFromView:toView:duration:options:completion:]</code>
            method to allow for animated transitions between views like cross dissolves, page flips,
            and 3D "card flip" effects (see the video to the left).
          </li>
          <li>
            A <code>ui2.bind</code> decorator which allows binding Python methods to keybaord
            shortcuts on bluetooth keyboards connected to the device, functionality which was
            previously entirely unavailable. Keyboard shortcuts even show up in the "discoverability"
            menu when the command key is held down on the keyboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            New <code>Animation</code> and <code>ChainedAnimation</code> classes allow for playing
            multiple animations in sequence without manually creating delays for the duration of
            each animation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Redesigned interface for asynchronous UI-related code execution in the form of brand new
            <code>Delay</code> and <code>DelayManager</code> classes which allow not only for the
            scheduling of asynchronous actions in the future but for the subsequent cancellation and
            mutation of these events, which is impossible using Pythonista's built-in <code>ui.Delay</code>
            interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new <code>ui2.Path</code> class to replace <code>ui.Path</code> that stores each
            component of the path in memory so that it can be read back after the path is modified.
            The old <code>ui.Path</code> class was write-only and it was impossible to retrieve
            information about the components of the path. <code>ui2.Path</code> intercepts every
            method call and remembers each piece added to the <code>Path</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
