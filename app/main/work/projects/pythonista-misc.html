        For many years, I was one of the most active members of the community surrounding the iOS
        app <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/">Pythonista</a>, a fantastic platform for
        mobile Python development, and one of the most powerful apps for developers on the iOS
        platform as a whole. During the time that I spent most heavily using the platform, I made
        several meaningful and well-used contributions to the software community surrounding the
        app, many of which took the form of libraries that brought new functionality to the app.

        One significant contribution I made to the community was the initial creation and moderation
        of the collaborative <code>Pythonista-Tweaks</code> module, which aims to collect in one
        place some general enhancements, extensions, and modifications to Pythonista's behavior, and
        to generally fill in gaps in Pythonista's functionality by querying Objective-C APIs.

        An example of functionality that <code>Pythonista-Tweaks</code> enables. The script pictured
        displays progress in real-time as a badge on the app icon, useful for keeping users informed
        about the progress of long-running tasks even when the app is not open.

        <code>pythonista-theme-utils</code> is a utility I wrote for Pythonista that allows users to
        retrieve information about the user's current editor theme and to automatically style user
        interfaces to match the user's current editor theme. This is useful for the
        authors of scripts that are designed to perform tasks within the editor. At the time this
        script was written, this functionality was unavailable. However, just four days after I
        published my code, the developer of the Pythonista app integrated this functionality directly
        into the app, along with a credit to me in the release notes.
