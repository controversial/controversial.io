# To-Do List for Redesign
A growing list of what I need to accomplish before the redesign is done

- "Work" page


- "About" page improvements
  - [ ] Improved jump from 3D to flat while scaling
    - Gradually reduce `rotmax` to 0 while shrinking and call `rotate`Â repeatedly


- `LaptopCarousel` improvements
  - [ ] Close laptops completely and make animation more complex *Added 2017-12-03*
    - When shifting:
      1. Close current laptop
      2. Rotate
      3. Open new laptop
    - decouples hinge from rotation
  - [ ] Open when attempting to scroll down (Listen for `mousewheel`) *Added 2017-12-03*


- Improve performance
  - [ ] Implement a `derender` event on `NavigationAnimationBase` *Added 2017-12-03*
    - Can be used to halt expensive tasks when laptop contents are not visible
  - [x] Implement `will-change` everywhere *Added 2017-12-03*
